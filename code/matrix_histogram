function M = matrix_histogram(samples) 
% matrix_histogram constructs an array from samples whose columns are respectively
% . 20 equally spaced angles between 0 to pi with each angle being repeated a thousand times
% . Center of the boxes of each histogram formed by the quadrature measurements of samples of each angle separately, placed in 1000 bins.
% . Number of quadrature measure counts in each bin in respective histograms
