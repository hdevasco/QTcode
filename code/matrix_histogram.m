function M = matrix_histogram(numAngles, samples, option, H_operator,deltaq)

% matrix_histogram discretizes the (continuous values) output of the function homodyne_samples,
% giving as result a matrix containing the discretized values.
%   Function inputs:
%      numAngles = number of evenly spaced phases from 0 to Pi. 
%                  In https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07414.pdf this is 'm' (= 20).
%      samples = matrix containing the results of the homodyne measurements.
%      option = indicates the method to set the width of the histogram bin:
%            -If 'number_of_bins' is chosen, the histogram will be constructed using 
%             a number deltaq of bins.
%            -If 'bin_width' is chosen, the histogram will be constructed using bins 
%             with width given by deltaq. 
%            -If 'bin_leonhardt' is chosen, the bin width will be given by Leohnardt's equation.
%            -If 'scott_true' is chosen, the width will be given by Scott's formula.
%            -The other options ('auto', 'scott', 'fd', 'inteiros', 'sturges', 'sqrt') use 
%             the automatic binning algorithm from the Matlab function histcounts. This 
%             binning algorithm returns bins with a uniform width, chosen to cover the 
%             range of elements in the distribution and reveal the underlying shape of the
%             distribution.
%      H_operator = defines how the measuring operator to be used on the tomography will 
%      be chosen:
%            -If 'center' is chosen, each binâ€™s measurement operator represents the 
%             measurement as if it occurred at the center of each bin.
%            -If 'integral' is chosen, each binâ€™s measurement operator represents a 
%             measurement that occurs anywhere in the bin. 
%      deltaq = is used when 'number_of_bins' or 'bin_width' is chosen. deltaq will represent
%               the number of bins when using 'number_of_bins' and will represent the bin 
%               width when using 'bin_width'.     
%  Function output = is a matrix of histograms M, built according to the sample and the chosen
%                    measuring operator: H_operator = center or H_operator = integral. 
%                    If H_operator = center, the output matrix M will be a three column 
%                    matrix (angle, measurement at the center of the bin, number of counts 
%                    in each bin). If H_operator = integral, the matrix M will be a four 
%                    column matrix (angle, left edge of the bin, right edge of the bin, 
%                    number of counts in each bin).

% In lines 43 to 46 we construct the histogram matrix when only the two first input of M 
% are specified (numAngles and sample). In this case, we use the edges of the bins whose 
% width was chosen by Leonhardt's method and a measurement operator set to 'integral'. When 
% we use H_operator = integral, we numerically integrate the measurement operators over the
% width of each histogram bin, getting a better estimative.
if nargin == 2
  option = 'bin_leonhardt';
  H_operator = 'integral';
